# Drum Machine feat. Rick and Morty

See the project live: https://sitek94.github.io/drum-machine/

App functionality is based on `user stories` from **freeCodeCamp**, you can check them out here: [Build a Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine)

## Motivation
While building the app my goal was to practice following concepts/technologies:
* React, React Hooks
  * basic animations
  * playing sounds
  * keyboard events
* Material UI
  * theming
